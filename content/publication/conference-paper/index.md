abstract: Computer vision as a field is an intellectual frontier. Like any frontier, it is exciting and disorganized, and there is often no reliable authority to appeal to. Many useful ideas have no theoretical grounding, and some theories are useless in practice; developed areas are widely scattered, and often one looks completely inaccessible from the other. Nevertheless, we have attempted in this book to present a fairly orderly picture of the field.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
